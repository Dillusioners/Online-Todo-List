# Online-Todo-List
Our online todo list is a console-based windows app that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks or activities that they need to complete. Users can typically add, edit, and delete tasks. This tool is useful for individuals or teams who want to stay organized and keep track of their daily or long-term responsibilities.
